## Welcome

This is my **_zettelkasten_** / _digital garden_ / _personal wiki_ / _knowledge base_ / whatever you want to call it.[^1]

Here, I write down my thoughts and notes on things I'm learning about.
This is where I put [ideas in to be forgotten](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36136179)[^2] but which I also deem important enough to write down.
I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)/[Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/) to help me manage these notes, and I use [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) to publish them to the web.[^3]
