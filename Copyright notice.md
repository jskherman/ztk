## Content

The **text of my notes**, that is, most of the content of the wiki, is **_all-rights-reserved._** You are welcome to read, learn from, and link to all notes (including clicking the `§` icon in the upper-right of each heading in a note) to copy a link to any note/page; keep in mind that currently public notes could become private in the future, though I try to avoid doing this). Obvious [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) such as quoting a small excerpt with attribution in order to discuss it is also fine. Please [contact me](https://go.jskherman.com/contact) if this doesn't cover something you were hoping to do.

## Quartz

Just like a TiddlyWiki site, a personal wiki/zettelkasten that is public blurs the lines between code and data. However, unlike a TiddlyWiki where tiddlers (read: notes) can be divided into  **content** or **system tiddlers**, what's different about the implementation in this zettelkasten site is that I only have claim to the copyright of my notes that I have created. I use [Quartz by @jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) to do the heavy lifting of publishing these notes online.

The code that directly comes from [@jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0)'s [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) project and the code that functionally extends it, in terms of the build process, in the [GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/jskherman/ztk) are subject to the [license used by Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/v4/LICENSE.txt) (which as of this writing is the MIT License).

Do be mindful that many dependencies used by Quartz itself or other extensions may be licensed under a different, usually open-source, license and not necessarily the MIT License.
